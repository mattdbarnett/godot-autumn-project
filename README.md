# Autumn Semester Project


## To-Do:

### Allow the user to customise their game experience with different options and modes
1. Give the user different pre-set gamemodes to choose from.
2. Allow the user to start a game from the custom menu.
3. Give functionality to the different options on the custom menu.
4. Allow for some form of adjustment of gameplay from the settings menu.

## Finished:

1. Finished menu prototype for Week 4.
2. Created basics for player scene, user led-movement and player interaction with the game-world.
3. Made a 2D procedurally-generated game-space, where different parts of the world have different qualities.
