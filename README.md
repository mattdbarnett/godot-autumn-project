# Autumn Semester Project


## To-Do:

### Create the Player Character
1. ~~Create a player character scene.~~
2. ~~Simulate physics and movement for the player character - constant movement to the right and falling up/down dependent on gravity.~~
3. ~~Create game-scene where the player character scene is deployed.~~
4. Ensure the player character dies when a solid wall is hit and movement is halted - causing the game to end.
5. Ensure the player character dies when touching red.
6. Allow for the game-gravity to change upon player input, allowing user-caused movement.

## Finished:
