# Godot Autumn Semester Project

An open-source, basic, procedurally generated side-scrolling game with a variety of customisation options and goals.
It is open-source and aims for a eventual release on Steam, and potentially other platforms post-PC-release.

## Installation Instructions

All releases of the game are avaliable in the following directory: "res://6 Releases/".
To run a release, simply copy the '.exe' file and its sibling '.pck' file to a directory of your choice and run the executable from there.
It is recommended to execute and/or copy the most recent release within the releases directory.
