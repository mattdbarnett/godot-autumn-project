**Warning: This is currently only a wireframe-prototype of the final, planned product. It has no function outside of menu navigation.**

## To-Do:

1. ~~Create base project environment for the menus.~~
2. Finish early-version of the "Main" Menu.
3. Finish early-version of the "Play" Menu.
4. Finish early-version of the "Custom" Menu.
5. Finish early-version of the "Store" Menu.
6. Finish early-version of the "Settings" Menu.
7. Finish early-version of the "Help" Menu.

*(Finished menus at this stage are expected to be modified and changed later in developed, post-prototype phase.)*
