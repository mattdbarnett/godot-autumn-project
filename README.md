# Autumn Semester Project


## To-Do:

### Make the 2D game-space procedurally generated
1. Create infinite terrain for the player to travel through.
2. Ensure there is both a floor and a ceiling for the player to switch between.
3. Create height/size variations in the generated terrain.
4. Ensure the qualities of each terrain-piece are randomly chosen.

## Finished:

1. Finished menu prototype for Week 4.
2. Created basics for player scene, user led-movement and player interaction with the game-world.
