# Godot Autumn Semester Project

A basic, procedurally generated side-scrolling game with a variety of customisation options and goals.
It is open-source and aims for a eventual release on Steam, and potentially other platforms post-PC-release.

## Installation Instructions

All releases of the game are avaliable in the following directory: "res://6 Releases/".
To run a release, simply copy the exe and it's corresponding pck file to a directory of your choice and run them from there.
It is recommended to execute and/or copy the most recent release within the directory.

## Frameworks and APIs

The frameworks used to develop this game is the Godot Engine, and will be required in order to edit and run the project.
I also opted to develop this project using the GDScript variant, rather than the C# fork.
