# Godot Autumn Semester Project

A basic, procedurally generated side-scrolling game for my third year of undergrad.

## Installation Instructions

Currently there is no executable release for the project, though the latest stable build in main will run without error in the Godot IDE.

## Overall Plans/Aims

1. ~~Finished menu prototype for Week 4.~~
2. ~~Created basics for player scene, user led-movement and player interaction with the game-world.~~
3. ~~Made a 2D procedurally-generated game-space, where different parts of the world have different qualities.~~
4. ~~Give the user a range of methods to play - including a custom-made experience and pre-set gamemoeds.~~
5. ~~Allow for the collection of in-game currency that can be used in an in-application score.~~
6. ~~Create a help screen for new users.~~
